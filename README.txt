Keywords: git diff blame

Show the output of git diff with the additional information of git blame for
added/removed lines so that it's 'trivial' to find out who did what.

Example output (from difflame project itself, two revisions apart):

$ ./difflame c4dae4fdd8ba883 97d230ce523

OUTPUT FORMAT
Lines that remain the same or that were added will indicate when those lines
were 'added' to the file.
Lines that were removed will display the revision where the line was removed.
When it's not possible to pinpoint the revision where it was deleted, the last
revision where that line was present is reported instead (as reported by
git blame --reverse). When this happens, a percentage sign (%) will be used as
the prefix of the deleted line (instead of the usual -).

Notice how a 'hint' line is printed for lines that are removed/added and that
relate to the same revision. This is so that it's possible to get a little more
information about the revision itself without having to resort to an additional
call to git show.

You can provide one or two committishes. If you provide only one, HEAD will be
assumed to be the second committish.

You can also provide paths (which will be proxied into git diff) after --.

Parameters can be sent to git diff by using option --diff-param (or -dp), for
example:
    --diff-param=--color
Multiple parameters are possible, each one having a separate --diff-param/-dp.
Most times, different options will change diff output and it will break difflame

Parameters can be sent to git blame by using option --blame-param (or -bp), for
example:
    --blame-param=-l
    -bp=-t
Multiple parameters are possible, each one having a separate --blame-param/-bp:
    --blame-param=-l -bp=-t

options:
    --color/--no-color: output with/without color
        if user doesn't specify --color/--no-color options then output will use
        color if process is connected to a terminal
        
    -w: skip space changes (in both diff and blame)
    
    --no-hints: when printing added/removed lines, do not provide the hint
        (one-line summary of the revision) before the lines themselves.
        If a number of added/removed lines belong to the same revision one
        after the other, a single hint line would be printed before them.
        It would have looked something like this with hints disabled (taken
        from git project):
